<b>LaundryBot rules</b>

We are not a dry cleaner, we do not have the necessary equipment for this title.
We are a good laundry.

❗️ In the event that We did not remove the stains or did not wash well enough. The client has the right to return the item for re-washing free of charge.
❗️ In the event that We have spoiled the thing, and the thing cannot be restored (put stains that were not there before handing over to us; tore the thing during washing or drying; caused mechanical damage). We refund the cost of the item, but not more than 300,000 IDR for each item, provided that the order is fully paid.
‌❗️ In case the client is not satisfied with the wash, does not want to give it back for a second wash, but wants to receive a refund of the amount paid for the wash. We will fully refund the amount for washing and will not accept orders from this client in the future.
